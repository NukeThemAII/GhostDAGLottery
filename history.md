### Implementation

#### Smart Contract Development
- **Approach taken**: Built comprehensive lottery contract with UUPS upgradeable pattern
- **Key decisions**: 
  - Used Solidity ^0.8.30 for latest features and security
  - Implemented 5+1 number lottery system (5 main numbers 1-50, 1 bonus number 1-10)
  - Created 6-tier prize distribution system
  - Added automated draw scheduling with configurable intervals
  - Integrated donation system for community prize pool contributions
  - Implemented comprehensive access control and security measures

- **Challenges encountered**: 
  - Solidity version compatibility issues with OpenZeppelin contracts
  - Type conversion errors in ticket management
  - DocstringParsingError with invalid @version tag

- **Solutions implemented**:
  - Updated hardhat.config.ts to support multiple Solidity versions (0.8.20 and 0.8.30)
  - Fixed variable shadowing by renaming local variables
  - Corrected documentation tags from @version to @notice

#### Frontend Development
- **Approach taken**: Complete UI overhaul with modern design system
- **Key decisions**:
  - Replaced default Scaffold-ETH homepage with custom lottery dashboard
  - Created modular component architecture in components/lottery/
  - Implemented glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds
  - Used tabbed interface for different lottery functions
  - Integrated real-time contract state synchronization

- **Component Architecture**:
  - `LotteryDashboard`: Main navigation hub with role-based access
  - `LotteryOverview`: Real-time statistics and game information
  - `TicketPurchase`: Interactive number selection with quick pick
